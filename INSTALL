REQUIREMENTS
============

ffmpeg-0.4.9pre1 or higher built with the --enable-shared option and without the --enable-swscale option (ffmpeg svn recommended)
php-5.0.x or higher. For php-4.x.x, use ffmpeg-php-0.5.1 or older.
gd-2.0.x or higher or the version of GD bundled with PHP

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

These instructions are for Linux since I don't have windows. If you
successfully build on windows, let me know how you did it and I'll update 
these instructions.

BUILDING FFMPEG
---------------

cd /path/to/ffmpeg
./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr
make clean && make
[become root]
make install


BUILDING FFMPEG-PHP AS A SHARED EXTENSION 
-----------------------------------------

1. Build php if not already built or installed by your distro (See the file INSTALL in your php source directory)

2. Unpack the archive

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.x.x.tbz2 -C /path/to/php_sources/ext/

3. cd into the ffmpeg extension directory

        cd /path/to/php_sources/ext/ffmpeg-php.X.X.X/

4. Run phpize (included with your php install) to build configuration files

        phpize

5. Configure and build

        ./configure && make

6. Install the shared extension 

        make install (as root)

If everything went as planned, ffmpeg-php is now installed as a shared library. 
You must explicitly load it in your scripts using dl(ffmpeg.so) or if you want 
it available to all scripts by default add extension=ffmpeg.so to your php.ini 
file which will tell php to load it when starting up.


BUILDING FFMPEG-PHP AS PART OF THE PHP BINARY 
---------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the archive and copy the ffmpeg extension directory into your the php 
   sources extensions directory

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.x.x.tbz2 -C /path/to/php_sources/ext/

2. Run autoconf to rebuild the php configure script and add the --with-ffmpeg 
   option

        cd /path/to/php_sources
        autoconf
        
2. configure php using... 

        ./configure --with-ffmpeg=yes 
       
...and build and install php.

The ffmpeg-php methods should now be built directly into php and so no need to
explicitly load the extension at runtime.


TESTING THE INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Put the directory test_media and test_ffmpeg.php script under your web root
somewhere (put both in the same directory).

2. Load test_ffmpeg.php into your browser.

RESULTS: You should get a listing of the methods provided by the ffmpeg-php 
         module as well as some test output from the methods.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Q: I get '`gdImage' undeclared or `gdImagePtr''undeclared when I try to 
   'make' ffmpeg-php

A: Your version of php is compiled without gd support. Make sure to use the 
   '--with-gd' flag when configuring php. If you're sure you have gd but 
   it is not being detected, reconfigure the build with 
   '--enable-skip-gd-check' to force ffmpeg-php to build with gd support.

Q: I get 'avcodec.h: No such file or directory' when I try to 'make' ffmpeg-php 

A: ffmpeg-php can't find ffmpeg header files. Make sure when you configure 
   ffmpeg you use the '--enable-shared' option and make sure it installs 
   somewhere where other programs can find the libs/headers. See 
   'BUILDING FFMPEG' above for an example.

Q: Can I just pay you to install it?

A: Yes. I will install ffmpeg-php and prerequisites on your server for $75 USD.
   Shoot me an email at ffmpeg.php AT gmail.com if you are interested.
